%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Introduction %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Introduction}
It is widely known that it can be time-consuming to choose the wrong path, if you want to travel from one city to another. It will most certainly be faster to aboard the train from Chicago to Seattle, rather than going through Los Angeles before heading to Seattle. Choosing the right path will therefore save a lot of time.\\
The problem herein is that its in lots of cases is nowhere intuitive which path that guarantees the consumation of time to be minimal. We probably can't withstand the big amounts of information if we should compute the shortest path, through millions of combinations by ourselves. For computersystems to choose such a path, they'd need a method for calculating such, an algorithm.\\
Different shortest-path algorithms are known to solve such problems theoretically. We'll examine the theory behind these, and analyse the complexity to see whether the time-complexity given by Bellmann-Ford and Dijkstras algorithms holds in real life implementations, by implementing them with both a binary and a fibonacci-heap in C++, thus finally to match them all up against each other.\\
We'll as well analyse and implement the A*-algorithm to see how well dijkstra match up against this on euclidean planar graphs. Since we're primarily interested in road-maps, we won't consider negative weights.\\

\section{Problem definition}
To examine and benchmark the complexity of different shortest-path algorithms, e.g. Dijkstra, Bellmann-Ford, and A* Search. We will do this by implementing and comparing them using different data structures and libraries. Finally we will compare the results of these experiments with the theoretical bounds.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Notation %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Notation}
A short list of notations used throughout the thesis:
\begin{itemize}
\item $G(V,E)$ = Graph, consisting of set of vertices V, and set of edges E
\item $s$ = Designated to be the source vertex s
\item $w(u,v)$ = Weighted distance from vertix u to v
\item $d[v]$ = The weigth of the current shortest path from s to v. $d[v]$ is initlized to be $\infty$ for all vertices besides the source vertex. $d[s]$ is initialized to be 0.
\item $\pi[v]$ = Predecessor/parent vertex to v in the current shortest path. $\pi[v]$ is initialized to be NIL. This is set to a vertex once/if a path is discovered from s to v.
\item $\delta(u,v)$ = the weigth of the shortest path from u to v.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Shortest Paths %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{On Shortest Paths}
In the shortest path problem, a graph $G = (V,E)$ is given, where $V$	
is the set of vertices, and $E$ is the set of edges. Each edge
connects two vertices and contains a weight, indicating the cost of
moving between these vertices. By using a shortest path algorithm, we
can find a shortest path $P = {v_{1}, v_{2}, ..., v_{k}} \in V$ from a
given source vertex $s \in V$ to all other vertices $v \in V$. I.e.,
we want to find a path, where the total weight of the visited edges is
minimal.\\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Relaxation %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\noindent
\textbf{Relaxation}\\
When searching for the shortest path from a source vertex $s$ to a
vertex $v$, a shortest-path estimate $d[v]$ is preserved for each
vertex $v \in V$. To initialize the estimate and predecessor for all vertices, the following function is used:\\

\textbf{INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE$(G, s)$}
\begin{enumerate}
\NumTabs{24}
\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item \textbf{for } each vertex $v \in G.V$
\item \tab{$d[v] = \infty$}
\item \tab{$\pi[v] = NIL$}
\item $d[s] = 0$
\end{enumerate}
The shortest-path estimate for the source is 0, since this is where the algorithm begins. The other vertices' distance is set to $\infty$, since the path from $s$ to a vertex $v$ is unknown at start. Not knowing the path also results in the predecessor being unknown, which is why $\pi[v]$ is set to NIL.\\
At first, $d[v]$ will be an overestimate, but if we see that the shortest path to $v$ can be improved by going through a vertex $u$, we update the estimate $d[v]$ with the new and lower cost. As better paths are found, we will eventually get the correct estimate and find the shortest path, if it exists. This technique is called relaxation and is used by the three algorithms that we will talk about later. The pseudocode for relaxing an edge $(u,v) $ is shown below:\footnote{Introduction to Algorithms, pg. 649}\\

\textbf{RELAX$(u, v, w)$}
\begin{enumerate}
\NumTabs{24}
\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item \textbf{if } $d[v] > d[u] + w(u,v)$
\item \tab{$d[v] = d[u] + w(u,v)$}
\item \tab{$\pi[v] = u$}
\end{enumerate}
If the current distance from a source to the vertex $v$ is larger than the path going through vertex $u$ to $v$, the estimate is updated. And the predecessor for $v$ will then be $u$. The figure below illustrates the procedure of relaxing an edge $(u,v)$. Before relaxing the edge, we have that $d[v] > d[u] + w(u,v)$. $d[v]$ therefore gets decreased. Had the condition not been true, $d[v]$ would have remained at the same value of 10.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Properties %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Proving the correctness of shortest path algorithms}
The shortest path algorithms that we have talked about will always find a shortest path, if it exists. This can be proved by looking at the properties that shortest paths and relaxation have:\footnote{Introduction to Algorithms, pg. 650}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Triangle inequality}\\
The triangle inequality lemma is a geometric property of triangles which states that the sum of two lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the remaining side. That is, for any triangle with sides $\{x,y,z\}$, we have that $z \leq x+y$.\\\\
Applied to the shortest path problem we have that for any edge $(u,v) \in E$, we have $\delta(s,v)\leq \delta(s,u) + w(u,v)$ (\textbf{Lemma 1}). Thus the shortest path from s to v must be less than or equal to the shortest path from s to u added to the weigth from u to v.\\
\item \textbf{Upper-bound property}\\
The upper-bound property says that our estimate for the shortest distance to v is always greater than or equal to the actual shortest path from s to v, for all vertices v$\in$ V.\\\\
That is $\forall v \in V.(d[v]\geq \delta(s,v))$. Once our estimate holds the actual value for the shortest path, the estimate never changes (\textbf{Lemma 2}).\\
\item \textbf{No-path property (\textbf{Corollary to Lemma 2})}\\
If there is no path from s to v, then we always have $d[v] = \delta(s,v) = \infty$.\\
\item \textbf{Convergence property}\\
The convergence property ensures us that if we from s, at sometime has u to v is the shortest path in G for some u,v $\in$ V, and if the estimated shortest path to u actually is the shortest path, we'd then have (prior to relaxing the edge (u,v)) that the estimated shortest path to v must be the shortest path to v at all times afterward.\\\\
That is, if $s\rightsquigarrow u\rightarrow v$ is a shortest path, and if $d[u] = \delta(s,u)$, then $d[v] = \delta(s,v)$ is assured at all time afterward (\textbf{Lemma 3}).\\
\item \textbf{Path-relaxation property}\\
Our path-relaxation property ensures that the relaxation of a shortest path p will derive that the distance to the k'th vertix in p is equal to the shortest path to vertix k.\\\\
Let $p = \{v_{1}, v_{2},\cdots ,v_{k}\}$ be a shortest path that goes from $v_{1}$ to $v_{k}$. If the edges are relaxed in the order $(v_{1},v_{2}), (v_{2},v_{3}), \cdots , (v_{k-1}, v_{k})$, then $d[v_{k}] = \delta(s,v_{k})$ once the whole path is relaxed \footnote{Shortest Paths: 6.006 Intro to Algorithms, March 30 2011, Recitation 14. MIT}(\textbf{Lemma 4}).\\
\item \textbf{Predecessor-subgraph property}\\
The predecessor-subgraph/parent-subgraph property ensures that once the shortest path to v is computed for all vertices v, the predecessor subgraph is a shorted-paths tree rooted at s.\\\\
Such that once $\forall v \in V.(d[v] = \delta(s,v))$ the predecessor subgraph that contains all the vertices with a finite distance from s, but with only edges that connects v to $\pi[v]$ is a shortest-path tree\footnote{Shortest Paths: 6.006 Intro to Algorithms, March 30 2011, Recitation 14. MIT} (\textbf{Lemma 5}).
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Dijkstra proof %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\noindent\textbf{Proving the correctness of Dijkstra's algorithm:}\\
To prove that Dijkstra's algorithm work, we will perform an induction proof.\\\\
\textbf{Loop Invariant}\\
$\forall u.$ EXTRACT-MIN(Q) $\to (d[u] = \delta(s,u))$\\\\
\textbf{Initialization}\\
$S = Q = \{s\}$. Thus invariant holds since EXTRACT-MIN(Q) = $s$.\\\\
\textbf{Maintenance}\\
We wish to show that for each iteration, our loop invariant holds. Upon extracting the minimum from Q, we do MIN-HEAPIFY which ensures that for each vertex $V$ in $Q$, we have that the node $Q.L \geq Q.v \leq G.R$\\\\
Assume that the min-heap always extracts a vertex $u$ with the shortest-path estimate. Thus, if we decompose the path $p$ into $s  \rightsquigarrow y \to u$, we have that $d[y] = \delta(s,y)$. From the convergence property, this means that $d[u] = \delta(s,y) + w(y,u)$.\\\\
The invariant holds since $u =$ EXTRACT-MIN(Q) thus that $d[u] = \delta(s,u)$.\\\\
\textbf{Termination}\\
We terminate once either $Q = \O$ or if we found $t$. If $\exists t \in S$, we can backtrace the predecessors to obtain $\delta(s,t)$. Otherwise, we have that $\delta(s,t) = \infty$ by the no-path property.\\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Bellman-Ford %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Bellmann-Ford algorithm}
...\\
If there is a negative cycle, the cost of the shortest path is decreased every time the algorithm runs through the negative cycle. By doing this numerous times, we can receive arbitrarily negative weights, thus making the cost undefined.\\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Dijkstra %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Dijkstra's algorithm}
Dijkstra's algorithm takes a weighted graph $G = (V, E)$ and finds the shortest path from a single source to each other vertex in the graph. To keep track of the vertices, the algorithm maintains two sets of vertices. The set $S$ consists of vertices, where the optimal shortest-path estimate from the source $s$ has been figured. The other set $Q$ is a minimum priority queue that contains the remaining vertices, i.e. $Q = V - S$. The algorithm will repeatedly extract a vertex with the minimum shortest-path estimate from $Q$ and add it to $S$, until all vertices have been discovered.\\

\noindent 
\textbf{Assumptions}\\
For Dijkstra's algorithm to work, we must assume that the graph contains no negative weights. Once a vertex has been extracted from the min-priority queue, Dijkstra's algorithm will assume that the shortest path to that vertex has been found. This means the algorithm will never have to relax this vertex again. However, if there is a negative-weighted edge somewhere, the algorithm may find a wrong shortest-path.\footnote{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13159337/why-doesnt-dijkstras-algorithm-work-for-negative-weight-edges} An example can be seen in the following figure:\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{neg-weight.png}
\caption{A graph with negative weights}
\end{figure}

\noindent In this figure, the graph consists of three vertices $A, B,$ and $C$. Dijkstra's algorithm starts at the source $A$ and will first extract $C$, since it has the shortest-path estimate of 2. Afterwards, the algorithm extracts the last vertex $B$ and terminates. Had it however tried to relax the negative edge between $B$ and $C$, a shorter path of $7 - 6 = 1$ would have been discovered. The result is therefore incorrect due to dijkstra utilizing the greedy property of \textbf{Lemma 1}, thus that $\forall (u,v) \in E.(w(u,v) \geq 0)$. \\

\noindent
(\textbf{Does the graph have to be connected???}\\
A connected graph means that for all $v \in V $,a vertex $v$ will be reachable from another vertex $w$ through an edge. If the graph is disconnected, some vertices will be unreachable, thus making some shortest paths infinite, if we try to reach these vertices.)\\\\


\noindent
\textbf{How Dijkstra's algorithm works}:\\
The pseudocode for Dijkstra's algorithm can be seen below:\footnote{Introduction to Algorithms, pg. 658}\\

\textbf{DIJKSTRA$(G, w, s)$}
\begin{enumerate}
\NumTabs{24}
\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE$(G, s)$
\item $S = $ \O
\item $Q = G.V$
\item $\textbf{while } Q \neq$ \O
\item \tab{$u = $ EXTRACT-MIN$(Q)$}
\item \tab{$S = S \cup \{u\}$}
\item \tab{\textbf{for} each vertex $v \in G.Adj[u]$}
\item \tab{}\tab{RELAX$(u,v,w)$}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent The graph is initialized in line 1 by calling INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE. For each vertex $v \in G.V$, the function sets the shortest-path estimate to $\infty$ and predecessor to NIL. $d[s]$ is set to 0. Dijkstra's algorithm maintains two sets, $S$ and $Q$. The set $S$ contains the vertices, whose final shortest-path estimates have been determined. In the beginning, no paths have been determined and thus $S$ will be empty (line 2). The min-priority queue $Q$ contains the vertices, whose shortest paths have not been found yet and is keyed by the vertices' current shortest-path estimates. In other words, the set of vertices in the graph is equal to the two sets, $V = S + Q$. $Q$ will contain all vertics in the graph at start (line 3).\\
We want to find $d[v]$ for all vertices, so Dijkstra's algorithm runs until the priority queue is empty. While $Q$ is not empty, the algorithm extracts the vertex with lowest $d[v]$ from $Q$ and adds it to the set $S$ (line 4 to 6). Afterwards, we examine for each vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$ if the shortest path found so far can be enhanced by taking the path through $u$. This is done by relaxing the edge $(u,v)$ (line 7 to 8).\\


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Dijkstra  modified %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\noindent The original pseudocode finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices. We are only interested in finding the shortest path for a single target. so we have modified the original pseudocode for Dijkstra's algorithm. As soon as the algorithm finds the shortest path to the target vertex, it will terminate. This will reduce the amount of vertices visited, unless the target happens to be the last vertex found.\\

\textbf{MODIFIED-DIJKSTRA$(G, w, s, t)$}
\begin{enumerate}
\NumTabs{24}
\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item $d[s] = 0$
\item $S = Q = \{s\}$
\item $\textbf{while } Q \neq  $ \O
\item \tab{$u = $ EXTRACT-MIN$(Q)$}
\item \tab{\textbf{if } $u = t$}
\item \tab{}\tab{\textbf{Terminate}}
\item \tab{\textbf{for} each vertex $v \in G.Adj[u]$}
\item \tab{}\tab{\textbf{if } $v \notin S$}
\item \tab{}\tab{}\tab{$S = S \cup \{v\}$}
\item \tab{}\tab{}\tab{$Q = Q \cup \{v\}$}
\item \tab{}\tab{}\tab{$d[v]  = d[u] + w(u,v)$}
\item \tab{}\tab{}\tab{$\pi[v] = u$}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent The pseudocode now takes a 4th parameter $t$, indicating the target vertex we want to find. Instead of calling the function \textit{INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE}, we only set the source's shortest-path estimate to 0. All other vertices are already assumed to have a shortest-path estimate equal to $\infty$, so it is not necessary to initialize the estimates to $\infty$.\\\\
The set $S$ no longer contains the vertices, whose final shortest-path estimates have been found. Instead, the set $S$ now consists of vertices $v$ for which a path to $v$ has been considered. By subtracting $S$ from $V$, we would get the set of vertices where $d[v]=\infty$ in the original Dijkstra's algorithm. The min-priority queue $Q$ has also been modified. Instead of adding all vertices in the graph, we only want to insert new vertices into the queue as they are discovered.\\ 
At start, $s$ is added to the sets $S$ and $Q$, since only the path to the source has been discovered and considered (line 2). Line 4 extracts a vertex $u$ with the minimum shortest-path estimate. If the vertex $u$ is the target vertex, the algorithm terminates. Else, the algorithm examines each vertex $v$ that is adjacent to $u$ in line 7. If $v$ has not been examined before, it will not be an element of $S$ or $Q$. Thus, we add $v$ to $S$ and $Q$. After this, the edge $(u,v)$ is relaxed, since $d[v]=\infty$ prior to being found and the predecessor is set to $u$.\\\\
The following figure illustrates the difference between the two algorithms.\\
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{dijkstra.png}
\caption{Dijkstra's algorithm vs. the modified Dijkstra's algorithm}
\end{figure}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% A* search %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{A* search}
Our goal with A* search is to minimize the number of vertices visited, before the target vertex is found.\\\\
\textbf{How A* search algorithm works}:\\
We wish to find the shortest path to a single target, so the pseudocode is based on the pseudocode for the modified Dijkstra's algorithm.\\

\textbf{A* Search$(G, w, s)$}
\begin{enumerate}
\NumTabs{24}
\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item $d[s] = 0$
\item $S = Q = \{s\}$
\item \textbf{for} each vertex $v \in G.V$
\item \tab{INCREASE-KEY$(Q, v, d[v] + \|t-v\| )$}
\item $\textbf{while } Q \neq  $ \O
\item \tab{$u = $ EXTRACT-MIN$(Q)$}
\item \tab{\textbf{if } $u = t$}
\item \tab{}\tab{\textbf{Terminate}}
\item \tab{\textbf{for} each vertex $v \in G.Adj[u]$}
\item \tab{}\tab{\textbf{if } $v \notin S$}
\item \tab{}\tab{}\tab{$S = S \cup \{v\}$}
\item \tab{}\tab{}\tab{$Q = Q \cup \{v\}$}
\item \tab{}\tab{}\tab{$d[v]  = d[u] + w(u,v)$}
\item \tab{}\tab{}\tab{$\pi[v] = u$}
\end{enumerate}
The difference is now that we also use heurestics to guide our search. Recall that Dijkstra's algorithm selects which vertex to visit next, by extracting the vertex with the lowest shortest-path estimate. For A* search, we also want to examine the Euclidean distance from a vertex $v$ to the target vertex $t$ for all vertices, $\|t-v\|$. Thus, A* search will maintain a min-priority queue $Q$, where vertices are keyed by $d[v]+\|t-v\|$. By repeatedly selecting the vertex with the lowest sum, we can get a more precise path search. This is illustrated on the following figure: ...\\
