# Bachelors Thesis

This is a Git-Hub page for the bachelors thesis made in spring 2016, by Susanne Truong and Bjarke Kingo Iversen. 

It contains relevant implementaions, project idea as well with the thesis itself.

**Abstract**

_In this thesis we present and discuss three shortest path algorithms; Bellman Ford, Dijkstra's algorithm, and A* search. We analyse the algorithms and their time complexities using the binary heap data structure. The algorithms are then implemented in C++ and undergo a benchmark test, where we measure the CPU time among other things. The benchmark showed that the difference in CPU time grew heavily when computing larger amounts of data, using the different algorithms. Bellman Ford performed the worst by a wide margin, while A* search performed the best._
